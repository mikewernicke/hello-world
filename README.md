# hello-world
Introduction - Just starting GitHub to begin my coding journey. The programming languagew I learned for my BS back in the day were PASCAL C, and a little bit of ADA (I know!). This old dog is quite able to learn new tricks though. Looking forward to playing with javascript and ruby soon.
